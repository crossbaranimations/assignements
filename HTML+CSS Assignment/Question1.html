        <p>Pratap Singh I, popularly known as Maharana Pratap, was a Hindu Rajput king of Mewar. He was titled as "Mewari Rana" and was notable for his military resistance against the expansionism of the Mughal Empire and is known for his participation in the Battle of Haldighati and the Battle of Dewair.</p>
        <p>Maharana Pratap was born in Hindu Rajput family to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai.[5][6][7] His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had 2 stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar.</p>
        <p>Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles. Rana Pratap's methods of guerrilla warfare was later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, and by Emperor Shivaji Maharaj.</p>
