    <h2>Video Series</h2>
    <p>
        Paying close attention to detailed design, well-profiled characters and smooth narrations are key to the most engaging productions. They are engaging because they give fun, evoke emotions, provide entertainment and educational value (if that’s the goal).
        But animation series are as fun to watch as they are challenging to produce. They require quite a methodical approach and consistency both in style and quality. Each stage needs to be well-thought-out and each element of the graphics has to be detailedly crafted in line with the given style, script and expectations.

    <h2>Character Design</h2>
    <p>
        If you want to tell your story through characters their design should play a crucial role in helping you put your best foot forward.
        The next step is to describe who should they be and how should they look. Both of these factors are strongly correlated to the story you want to tell and people you try to reach. If you communicate your message to children and the defined style allows it, your characters should be likable, friendly and often have… unnatural body proportions!       
        But if you’re targeted at more serious demographics, appropriate proportions and toned outfits will surely meet with better reception.

    <h2>Commercials</h2>
    <p>
        It's not only about convincing your prospects that your product or service is the best but also about answering why they need it.
        We’ll approach your video with a “beginner’s mind”, extracting the juice, keeping things simple, easy to understand and fun to watch.
        Animated commercials are equally effective in both online and offline campaigns. The production costs are lower compared to live-action TVCs and you maintain control over every element visible on the screen.
        This format gives you a perfect opportunity to make you and your product distinct in the thick network of communication streams. That’s an advantage that’s hard to overrate. Once your audience sees an animation in your specific style, they know it’s you and they can expect only the best.
